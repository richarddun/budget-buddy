Global configuration for the Budget Buddy app.

Set BASE_PATH to the subpath where the app is served behind a reverse proxy
(e.g., '/budget-buddy'). Leave it as an empty string for root deployment ('/').

This module centralizes configuration instead of relying solely on env vars.

# Example: BASE_PATH = "/budget-buddy"
BASE_PATH = "/budget-buddy"
