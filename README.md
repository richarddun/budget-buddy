# üìò Project README: Family AI Assistant ("Budget Buddy+")

## Overview

**Budget Buddy+** is a personalized AI assistant designed to help manage personal finances through YNAB integration, with future plans to evolve into a multi-skilled household agent. The system leverages LLMs (OpenAI and DeepSeek), `pydantic-ai`, a FastAPI backend, and real-time streaming UI with HTMX and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## üîÆ Future Vision (v2.0+)

### üë™ Multi-Skilled Family Assistant

Planned evolution into a general-purpose agent hub:

| Agent          | Domain                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Budget Agent   | Financial planning, YNAB integration   |
| Calendar Agent | Sync with Todoist or Google Calendar   |
| Meal Agent     | Weekly meals + budget-aligned shopping |
| Tutor Agent    | Educational enrichment for kids        |
| Wellness Agent | Journaling, check-ins, reminders       |

Each sub-agent will:

* Expose tool schemas for orchestration
* Return structured output (markdown, JSON, summaries)
* Use memory/state to track family-specific context

### üî≠ Roadmap
